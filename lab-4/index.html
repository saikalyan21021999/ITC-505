        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This HTML document was structured to present the resume of K Saikalyan Yadav in a clear and organized manner. Each section is separated into distinct <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags for readability and accessibility. Contact details are emphasized in the header, while education, skills, internships, and personal details are clearly outlined in respective sections. A footer is included to indicate the last modification date of the document.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
        <p>For this project, I aimed to enhance readability and aesthetics through various CSS properties:</p>
        
        <h4>Font Choices</h4>
        <p>I selected 'Arial, sans-serif' for its clean and modern look, ensuring readability across different devices. Headings use 'Georgia, serif' to add a touch of elegance and distinction from the body text.</p>
        
        <h4>Font Sizes</h4>
        <p>Headings are sized progressively to establish a clear hierarchy. The main text is set to 16px for comfortable reading. H1 is 32px, H2 is 24px, and H3 is 20px to differentiate various levels of importance.</p>
        
        <h4>Color Choices</h4>
        <p>A consistent color scheme is used with a dark blue (#2c3e50) for headings, providing a professional appearance. The body text is a dark gray (#34495e), ensuring high contrast against the white background for easy readability. Links are styled in a contrasting blue (#2980b9) to stand out.</p>
        
        <h4>Margins and Padding</h4>
        <p>Generous margins and padding around sections and elements create whitespace, preventing the content from appearing cluttered. Headings have top and bottom margins to separate them from the surrounding content.</p>

        <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
        <p class="margin-bottom">Originally, I might have used inappropriate tags for styling purposes. For instance, using <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for subtitles instead of <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> due to size preferences. All such instances have been corrected to reflect proper HTML semantics.</p>
